# Trampoline

### Description

Welcome to **Trampoline**.

Are you developing an application based on the _paradigm of microservices_ using spring boot? Are you **tired of that set of scripts**? Quiet, Trampoline has come in your life.

The aim is to **help during the course of developing an application based on the paradigm of microservices with _spring boot nature_**. How? Easy, thanks to a **comfortable interface** you can **declare new microservices**, **starting instances** and **kill them**.

### Requirements

* Java 8
* Apache Maven (v3.2.1)
* Enable shutdown endpoint on your spring boot microservices

### How do I make it work?

1. You just have to start the project trampoline and start it with the well known command mvn spring-boot:run. 
2. Once started, go to [localhost:8080/trampoline](http://localhost:8080/trampoline). 
3. Once there, the only thing you should do is enter the path to your apache maven. 
4. Finally you just have to declare your microservices and to start and/or to stop them as you wish.

### FAQ
* Can I run it on any OS?.

Theoretically yes, but only has been fully tested on Windows and Mac OS.

* Will I have to enter data all the time?.

No, information introduced will be stored in a settings file, next to the script to launch each microservices :grin:

* How does the UI look like?
