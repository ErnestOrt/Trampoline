# Trampoline

### Description

Welcome to **Trampoline**.

Are you developing an application based on the _paradigm of microservices_ using spring boot? Are you **tired of that set of scripts**? Quiet, Trampoline has come in your life.

The aim is to **help during the course of developing an application based on the paradigm of microservices with _spring boot nature_**. How? Easy, thanks to a **comfortable interface** you can **declare new microservices**, **starting instances** and **kill them**.

Also you will be able to:
* Configurable Actuator endpoint & VM arguments
* Monitor memory usage for each instance, capturing their metrics every 30 seconds.
* Monitor intances trace information any point in time
* Define microservices groups and launch them all with one click

### Requirements

* Java && (Apache Maven || Gradle wrapper)
* Start actuator sub-project of Spring Boot on your microservices
* Set up logging.path and/or logging.file properties defined on your microservices in order to be able to visulize logs
* Include your Gradle Wrapper next to your build files if build tool of choice is Gradle

### How do I make it work?

1. You just have to start the project trampoline and start it, for instance with the well known commands _mvn spring-boot:run_ or _./gradlew (or gradlew.bat) bootRun_. 
2. Once started, go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). 
3. Once there, the only thing you should do is enter the path to your apache maven or directly enter your microservices information if you will use a gradle wrapper on _Settings Section_. 
4. Finally you just have to start your instances on _Instances Section_.

### FAQ

* How does the UI look like?

![Alt text](https://github.com/ErnestOrt/Trampoline/blob/master/TrampolineUI_3.png)

* Which build tool are Trampoline compatible to use on my microservices?
	
You can use Apache Maven or a Gradle Wrapper

* Can I run it on any OS?.

Theoretically yes, but only has been fully tested on Windows and Mac OS.

* Will I have to enter data all the time?.

* I am working with Spring Boot 1.3 or less and instances do not start.

You should add security starter on your microservices pom.xml:

```
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>

```

No, information introduced will be stored in a settings file, next to the script to launch each microservices :grin:
